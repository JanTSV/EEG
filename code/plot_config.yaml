# ===== PATHS =====
# Relative paths are resolved from the config file's directory.
paths:
  # Input file: The result from the preprocessing step
  input_file: "../data/derivatives/pair-01_player-1_task-RPS_eeg-epo.fif"
  # Output directory for saving the plot images
  figures_dir: "../data/derivatives/figures"

# ===== PLOTTING CONFIGURATION =====
plot:
  # Title of the plot
  title: "ERP Analysis: Subject 1 (Grand Average)"
  
  # CHANNEL SELECTION:
  # Set this to "eeg" to plot ALL channels (Butterfly Plot).
  # Or provide a list like ["Fz", "Cz", "Pz"] for single channel views.
  # picks: ["Fz", "Cz", "Pz", "Oz"]
  picks: "eeg"
  
  # TIME WINDOW (Cropping):
  # Zoom in on the relevant ERP components (e.g., P300).
  # tmin/tmax: null means "take everything available".
  # Recommended for ERPs: tmin: -0.2, tmax: 1.0
  crop: 
    tmin: -0.2
    tmax: 1.0

  # CONDITIONS:
  # Currently, we only have "decision". Later, this could be ["Win", "Loss"].
  conditions: ["decision"]

  # STYLING & STATISTICS:
  # Show a small head map with sensor positions
  show_sensors: true
  
  # Variability mode for the plot:
  # "mean" = show only the average line (cleaner for butterfly plots).
  # "std" or "sem" = show standard deviation/error as a shadow (better for single channels).
  variability_mode: "mean"  

  # Should the plot open in an interactive window?
  interactive: true
