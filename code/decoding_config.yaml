# ===== EXPERIMENT SETTINGS =====
experiment:
  # If true, the script creates fake labels (Class 0 vs 1) if only 1 class is found.
  # Set to 'false' once you have real 'Rock/Paper/Scissors' events.

# ===== MODELS =====
# You can enable/disable specific models here.

models:
  # 1. Linear Discriminant Analysis (Sliding Window)
  # Focus: Temporal dynamics ("WHEN?")
  lda:
    enabled: true
    solver: "lsqr"
    shrinkage: "auto"  # recommended for EEG
    metric: "accuracy"

  # 2. Logistic Regression (Whole Trial Vectorized)
  # Focus: Robust Baseline ("HOW GOOD overall?")
  log_reg:
    enabled: true
    C: 1.0  # Regularization strength
    max_iter: 1000

  # 3. Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
  # Focus: Non-linear patterns
  # Note: Uses sklearn MLPClassifier to keep dependencies simple.
